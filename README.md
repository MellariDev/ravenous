# About this Project

The Ravenous Project is a Yelp-like clone that was completed through the Codecademy program for Web Development. It is meant to serve as a case study on fully developing a React application and implementing API's.

The API has been removed from the code and thus will no longer work. If you'd like to test it for yourself you must add your own key which can be obtained by following the instruction provided here: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started. Any further development was outside of the current scope of this project.

## Run this app locally

If you wish to test the app for yourself you must run it locally as long as you have your own API key as stated above. This can be done by creating a clone of the project and entering your API key in the Yelp.js file where it says 'userAPI' on line 1. Once these conditions have been met type 'npm start' into the console to start the app on the local host.
